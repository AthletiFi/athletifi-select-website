## Project Introduction
Our mission at AthletiFi is to redefine the way soccer fans engage with and support emerging talent in the world of soccer. We do this by creating NFT digital sports trading cards that dynamically display a player's latest performance stats using AI-assisted video recognition technology.

Each card represents a young player from elite soccer academies with whom we've partnered. By acquiring these NFTs, fans can invest in promising young athletes and follow their journey in a unique and engaging way. Additionally, the cards will be usable in an upcoming Web3 game, adding an extra layer of interactivity and fun.

Our project is about more than just soccer and NFTs - it's about building a sustainable ecosystem that benefits players, academies, and communities. AthletiFi employs a revenue-sharing model where proceeds from the platform go directly back to supporting the young players.
